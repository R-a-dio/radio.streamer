        Source
        ======

        The source should have the following attributes:

            :func:`read`:
                :param size: An :const:`int` signifying the amount of
                             bytes to return.
                :returns: A :const:`bytes` of PCM audio data
                          in supported format.

            :attr:`sample_rate`:
                The sample rate of the audio data. This should be
                the full integer of the sample rate (44100 instead
                of 44.1)

            :attr:`bits_per_sample`:
                The bits per sample of the audio data. This
                can be 16, 24 and 32 bits.

        =======
        Options
        =======

        The options available for the :class:`Encoder` is a single one named
        'lame_settings'. This is a list of arguments to pass to the underlying
        LAME encoder binary.

        The list should contain the encoding options of LAME only. Input and
        other options are handled by the implementation.

        The default encoding options are CBR192 @ 44.1kHz and joint stereo.
        Which looks like this:
            ['--cbr', '-b', '192', '--resample', '44.1']
